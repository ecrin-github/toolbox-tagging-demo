    "shortTitle": "Status Update Code of Conduct",
    "abstract": "Committed to the drafting of a Code of Conduct for the sector of health research according to Art. 40 GDPR, our initiative is advancing slowly but steadily. Throughout Europe, national jurisdictions differ to a great deal in their interpretations of the GDPR, especially in regard to its application in health research. This is due to some quite vague provisions (public interest, not incompatible clause) as wells as to numerous exemption/derogation clauses concerning the use of health data for research purposes, which encourage States to set up national rules \u2013 enhancing fragmentation. Notably, a Code of Conduct can help to bridge the harmonization gaps that may exist between Member States in their application of data protection law. On a practical level, a code is potentially a cost-effective method to achieve greater levels of consistency of protection as well as a mechanism to demonstrate compliance with the GDPR. By spring 2020, several hundred individuals representing around 90 organizations in the field of health research have indicated their interest and support for the Code of Conduct for Health Research. At this stage, this does not yet indicate an endorsement but means that they see a benefit in the development of such a code and are interested in partaking in the process. Additionally, several exchanges take place with national and sectoral codes in order to use synergies and finds ways for collaboration. This webinar is intended to inform you about the latest results.\n\nThe CINECA webinar series aims to discuss ways to address common challenges and share best practices in the field of cohort data analysis, as well as distribute CINECA project results.

    "shortTitle": "",
    "abstract": "The world is facing an unprecedented public health challenge with the COVID-19 pandemic; this has necessitated numerous efforts being deployed by governments, health agencies and individual institutions \u2013 including in the biobanking community \u2013 to develop effective tests, toolkits, treatments and vaccines to stem its spread and help fight it. To achieve this goal, the collection, analysis and timely sharing of samples and related data becomes instrumental in collective global research efforts. Aligned to these efforts is the prevalence for automated data processing and digital technologies such as location data and contact tracing applications as part of the toolkits. In this respect, biobanks are important infrastructures for access to these samples and data. Besides availability, quality and technical infrastructures, also ethical, legal and societal issues (ELSI) are particularly crucial in this regard. Public health ethics, personal data protection, ethics of data sharing, protection of consent and vulnerability as well as compliance issues within international data sharing have gained urgency in COVID-19 research. Against this backdrop, BBMRI-ERIC ELSI Services & Research held a webinar that took a closer look at these issues. The webinar took place on April 24th, 2020; the recording is available here. \u00a0 This document not only answers the questions posed during the webinar but ventures into much detail on the topics raised as a result. It also showcases two examples from Germany (presented by Prof. Roland Jahns) and Italy (presented by Prof. Marialuisa Lavitrano), as well as a detailed commentary on contact-tracing-apps from a legal perspective (presented by Gauthier Chassang). The document thus lays the foundation for further discussion on ELSI and COVID-19 in the context of biobanking.",

    "shortTitle": "",
    "abstract": "There is a growing international agreement on the need to provide greater access to research data and bio-specimen collections to optimize their long-term value and exploit their potential for health discovery and validation. This is especially evident for rare disease research. Currently, the rising value of data and bio-specimen collections does not correspond with an equal increase in data/sample-sharing and data/sample access. Contradictory legal and ethical frameworks across national borders are obstacles to effective sharing: more specifically, the absence of an integrated model proves to be a major logistical obstruction. The Charter intends to amend the obstacle by providing both the ethical foundations on which data sharing should be based, as well as a general Material and Data Transfer Agreement (MTA/DTA). This Charter is the result of a careful negotiation of different stakeholders' interest and is built on earlier consensus documents and position statements, which provided the general international legal framework. Further to this, the Charter provides tools that may help accelerate sharing. The Charter has been formulated to serve as an enabling tool for effective and transparent data and bio-specimen sharing and the general MTA/DTA constitutes a mechanism to ensure uniformity of access across projects and countries, and may be regarded as a consistent basic agreement for addressing data and material sharing globally. The Charter is forward looking in terms of emerging issues from the perspective of a multi-stakeholder group, and where possible, provides strategies that may address these issues.",
