In the case of “any type of data from living humans” (and only here), we want to know whether the resource is explicitly about sensitive data, which may be an important search criterion. There are different types of sensitive data, such as sensitive personal information or sensitive issues data. Sensitive personal information describes data that can be traced back to an individual and that, if disclosed could result in harm to that person. The following data is considered sensitive personal data and subject to specific processing conditions: personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs; trade-union membership; genetic data, biometric data processed solely to identify a human being; health-related data and data concerning a person’s sex life or sexual orientation. Sensitive issue data Includes – for example – sociological data relating to different social or ethnic groups, e.g. their occupations, income levels, criminality; psychological data, e.g. levels of mental illnesses, measured stress levels, or social psychology experiments.",
